While there exist theories that have states “more strongly entangled” than quantum theory, in the sense that
they show CHSH values above Tsirelson’s bound, all known examples of such theories have a strictly smaller
set of measurements. Therefore, in tasks which require both bipartite states and measurements, they do not
perform better than QM. One of the simplest information processing tasks involving both bipartite states and
measurements is that of entanglement swapping. In this paper, we study entanglement swapping in generalised
probabilistic theories (GPTs). In particular, we introduce the iterated CHSH game, which measures the power
of a GPT to preserve non-classical correlations, in terms of the largest CHSH value obtainable after n rounds of
entanglement swapping. Our main result is the construction of a GPT that achieves a CHSH value of 4 after an
arbitrary number of rounds. This addresses a question about the optimality of quantum theory for such games
recently raised by Weilenmann and Colbeck. One challenge faced when treating this problem is that there seems
to be no general framework for constructing GPTs in which entanglement swapping is a well-defined operation.
Therefore, we introduce an algorithmic construction that turns a bipartite GPT into a multipartite GPT that
supports entanglement swapping, if consistently possible.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Finding a set of operationally motivated axioms that single out QM has been a long-standing problem in the field of
foundations of quantum mechanics. Such an undertaking requires a mathematical framework that allows us to compare
QM with other theories, such as classical theory. Arguably
the most general framework is that of generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs) [1–9].
Within this framework, a large number of axioms have been
proposed over the years [10–16]. One of the main foci of
many investigations is the behavior of bipartite theories. In
particular, explaining why√CHSH-type experiments [17, 18]
in nature are bounded by 2 2, which Tsirelson [19] famously
showed to be the largest value allowed by quantum theory.
But, as it stands, we still have no definitive axiom singling out
quantum theory based on this property.
In their recent work [20], Weilenmann and
√ Colbeck turn to
multipartite theories to possibly explain 2 2. The argument
hinges on a well-known tension between the set of states and
measurements in a theory: Expanding state space to include
more correlations requires one to shrink the set of measurements in order to avoid the emergence of negative probabilities.
For example, bipartite boxworld [8, 9, 21] state space is the
biggest possible bipartite state space one could make. But,
as a consequence, the bipartite effect space (the space from
which the measurements are constructed) has only product
effects. This in turn, is the smallest possible bipartite effect
space.
Therefore, by adding a step of entanglement swapping before playing the CHSH game, the set of possible correlations achievable in theories with such state spaces shrink
(see [22, 23]). Quantum theory seems to strike the optimum

between √
these competing notions, in that the CHSH violation of 2 2 is preserved under entanglement swapping. And
indeed, Weilenmann and Colbeck show that, for the adaptive CHSH game [24], the winning probability of any theory
whose unipartite state and effect spaces are characterised by
regular polygons [25] is upper bounded by the winning probability of quantum theory.
Naturally, the question arises whether quantum theory is
optimal, in the sense that no post-quantum
theory can sus√
tain a CHSH violation greater than 2 2 through entanglement
swapping. To investigate this, we introduce the iterated CHSH
game, which is an extension of the adaptive CHSH game to
multiple rounds. The main result of this paper is to answer
this question in the negative, with the construction of a postquantum GPT which sustains the maximal-possible value of
4 over arbitrarily many rounds in the iterated CHSH game.
Along the way, we also discuss a simpler construction which
sustains a CHSH violation of 4 only for a finite number of
rounds.

A.

Generalised Probabilistic Theories

The main idea of GPTs is to model experiments as a two
step process. A preparation step which produces a state, and
a measurement step which probabilistically maps states to outcomes. Associated to each outcome of a measurement, comes
an effect.
Mathematically, states are modelled as members of a convex set (convexity corresponding operationally to probabilistic mixtures). Effects can be viewed as positive linear functionals on states. The pairing between a state ρ and an effect
e is interpreted as the probability of obtaining the outcome
corresponding to the effect e, given that we prepared the state
ρ.
It is useful to represent these operations diagrammatically.
For example, the CHSH experiment consists of a bipartite
state measured locally by two parties. The resulting contraction can be diagrammatically represented as in Fig. 1. This

sub-system. The unipartite effects e and f on the other hand, are represented by boxes with one port each. The full diagram represents the
probability that, on measuring ρ, Alice and Bob get the outcome corresponding to effect e and f respectively.

product of the local unipartite effects, i.e., the pairing

(see also Sec. II).
B.

Entanglement swapping

Contractions of the type depicted in Fig. 1, whose result is
a probability, are called full contractions. It is also possible to
define partial contraction of states and effects.
Note for example the situation in Fig. 2 (a), where a bipartite state ρ is measured only on sub-system 1 and the outcome
corresponding to the effect e is obtained. We will interpret the
resulting object as a (not necessarily normalised) conditional
state, which acts on effects f on the second sub-system as
⟨ρ12 , e1 ⊗ 12 ⟩ : f2 7→ ⟨ρ12 , e1 ⊗ f2 ⟩.

(2)

Here 1 is the identity channel, which operationally corresponds to “do nothing”.
Similarly, one can pair a bipartite effect with a unipartite
state. This situation is depicted in Fig. 2 (b) and mathematically corresponds to
⟨ρ1 ⊗ 12 , e12 ⟩ : σ2 7→ ⟨ρ1 ⊗ σ2 , e12 ⟩.

(3)

We can also extend these notions to the case of several
bipartite objects. Consider the situation where two bipartite
states are partially contracted with a bipartite effect, as depicted in Fig. 2 (c). This is the generalisation of the quantummechanical notion of entanglement swapping to GPTs. These
operations will occur so frequently, that we introduce a compact notation: For bipartite states ρ, σ and a bipartite effect
e, we denote the conditional bipartite state resulting from an
entanglement swapping procedure as
Jρ e σ K := ⟨ρ12 ⊗ σ34 , 11 ⊗ e23 ⊗ 14 ⟩.

(4)

Similarly, we can instead contract two bipartite effects, partially, with a bipartite state, as depicted in Fig. 2 (d). This

Outline

This paper is structured as follows. In Section II we state
our axioms for a theory under which entanglement swapping
is well-defined. We also present an algorithm to either show
that a given bipartite theory is inconsistent or extend it to a
multipartite theory in a consistent manner.
In Section III we discuss the iterated CHSH game.
In Section IV we discuss the notion of composite GPTs,
which can swap PR-box correlations for a finite number of
steps.
Finally, in Section V we present a GPT which sustains a
maximal violation of Tsirelson’s bound indefinitely under entanglement swapping, and provide an optimal strategy for the
iterated CHSH game.

II.

DEFINITION OF A THEORY

The main goal of this paper is to analyse the phenomenon
of entanglement swapping in the general context of GPTs. To
this end, it is necessary to specify the conditions on a theory
under which entanglement swapping is well defined.
There are a few choices we make therein. First, we will
choose the fundamental objects of our theory to be convex
cones rather than starting with the state/effect spaces. This
is because it is sufficient (and more convenient) to work with
cones in the present context, i.e., describing notions such as
entanglement swapping and partial contractions. The state

<!-- page 3 -->
3
and effects spaces of the theory are obtained as derived objects, in the usual way, as specified below.
Second, we find it a more natural construction to reinterpret the effects as the primal objects and the states as linear
functionals on the effects. The two formulations are clearly
equivalent. For a detailed exposition of such a construction
refer to the review [9].
Definition 1. A theory in which entanglement swapping is
well defined is specified by the following:

For every choice A0 , A1 , B0 , B1 ∈ X (1) , we define the
CHSH observable as
CHSH(A0 , A1 ; B0 , B1 )
:= A0 ⊗ B0 + A0 ⊗ B1 + A1 ⊗ B0 − A1 ⊗ B1 .

The CHSH value corresponding to the above choice of correlators and some choice of ρ ∈ S (2) is the expectation value of
the CHSH observable with respect to ρ, i.e.,
⟨ρ, CHSH(A0 , A1 ; B0 , B1 )⟩.

2. An element 1 ∈ V , called the unit effect.

Another important notion in the discussion that follows, is
that of closure under entanglement swapping. Given a theory with bipartite cones P (2) and D(2) , we say D(2) is closed
under entanglement swapping if

5. Closure under partial contractions, i.e.,

The same notions apply to dual entanglement swapping.

6. Invariance under permutations of systems, i.e., for every n ∈ N and π ∈ Sn , we have π(D(n) ) = D(n) and
π(P (n) ) = P (n) . Where, for ρ1···n ∈ D(n)
π(ρ1···n ) := ρπ(1)···π(n) .

Consistent Bipartite Theory

In this section, we are concerned with the following question. Given:
• A finite-dimensional vector space V ,

Similarly for effects.
• a non-zero element 1 ∈ V ,

From the above definition, we can derive the following:
For an effect e ∈ P (n) , define the negation
⊗n

¬e := 1

− e.

• a convex cone P ⊂ V ⊗ V ,
(6)

• a convex cone D ⊂ (V ⊗ V )∗ ,

Define the n-partite effect space as
E (n) := P (n) ∩ ¬(P (n) ).

(7)

Define the n-partite state space as
S (n) := {ρ ∈ D(n) | ⟨ρ, 1⊗n ⟩ = 1}.

(8)

Define the set of unipartite correlators as
X (1) := {e − ¬e | e ∈ E (1) }.

(9)

is it possible to produce a multipartite theory which has the
same unit effect, for which P (2) = P and D(2) = D?
We answer this question by constructing an algorithm that,
for an input n ∈ N, either produces n-partite cones P (n) and
D(n) by extending P and D, if consistently possible, or detects the inconsistency. The algorithm can be split into two
parts. First, a consistency check on the objects 1, P and D,
followed by an explicit construction of P (n) and D(n) for every n ∈ N. The algorithm is as follows:

(15)

Additionally, we have not specified in which format inputs
like V or P are to be supplied, or how the checks should be
performed. In this sense, it is a “template” for a concrete algorithm that depends on the mathematical properties of the input
data. For example, if P, D are polyhedral cones in Rd , then V
can be represented by the integer d and the cones by the facet
inequalities. In this case, all tests in Algorithm 1 are linear

programs. But more general situations also make sense, e.g.
cones defined in terms of semi-definite constraints.
Lemma 2. Given the input data V, 1, P, D, Algorithm 1 either
detects inconsistency, or returns consistent n-partite cones
P (n) and D(n) induced by the data, for any n ∈ N, in a finite number of steps.
Proof. If the function check consistency in Algorithm 1 returns “inconsistent”, then one of the axioms in Def. 1 is violated already at the level of bipartite objects and so there is no
consistent extension of the input.
We will now verify that if the function check consistency in
Algorithm 1 returns “consistent”, then there exists a theory as
advertised.
Indeed, the objects whose existence is posited by Axioms 1
and 2 are part of the problem data. Axiom 6 holds by construction given that the bipartite cones are invariant under permutations. Axiom 3(a) is checked directly. The n-partite
cones are constructed only using the unipartite and bipartite
cones. Therefore, Axioms 5(a) and 5(b) follow from Axiom 6
and closure under partial contractions, entanglement swapping and dual entanglement swapping, at the bipartite level.
Axiom 4(a) follows from Axioms 5(a) and 5(b) plus the positivity of the unipartite and bipartite cones, since tensor products preserve positivity. Axioms 3(b) and 4(b) follow by construction.
III.

THE ITERATED CHSH GAME

The iterated CHSH game, as previously alluded to, is an extension of the adaptive CHSH game from Ref. [24], to include
multiple rounds of entanglement swapping. The game can be
viewed as implementing a CHSH test after the use of a “GPT
repeater”, the generalisation of a quantum repeater to GPTs,
in order to probe the capacity of the repeater to propagate entanglement.
The iterated CHSH game is parameterised by n, referring
to the number of repeater units between the start and end
nodes. The players of the game are Alice (A), a collection
of n Bobs ({Bi }i=1,··· ,n ), and Charlie (C). Alice corresponds
to the start node, Charlie to the end node, and the Bobs to repeaters. The diagramatic reperesentation of the structure thus
produced is shown in Fig. 3
Each round of the game proceeds as follows. First, each
of the Bobs performs a bipartite measurement on the subsystems available to him, effectively leading to n rounds of entanglement swapping. They subsequently broadcast their outcomes. Alice and Charlie are then allowed to implement local
corrections based on the outcomes of the Bobs. Finally, Alice and Charlie perform a CHSH test. In addition to shared
randomness among all parties, each of the nearest neighbours
depicted in Fig. 3 may share a bipartite resource, but no other
multipartite resource. (The adaptive CHSH game of Ref. [24],
depicted in Fig. 4, is the iterated CHSH game for n = 1).
To calculate the resulting CHSH value between Alice
and Charlie in the general case, we simply sum over the
CHSH value corresponding to each outcome vector ⃗b =

The main idea of this construction is to use particles with
multiple “internal degrees of freedom”. Roughly speaking, we
assign to some d.o.f.’s the task of carrying the entanglement,
and to others the task of supporting entangled measurements.
As described below, this way, we can circumvent the tension
between state and effect space sizes. We call these particles
composites, as they can be viewed as a composite of particles
from smaller GPTs.
A.

An example

Consider the following example. Say we have particles
with two d.o.f.’s, labeled 1 and 2. Each d.o.f. supports the
same local effects and local states as a unipartite boxworld
theory ([9]). That is, if P and D are the unipartite boxworld
state and effect cones, then the effects measurable on each
composite particle are
Pc = P1 ˙
⊗P2 ,

FIG. 4. Diagrammatic representation of the structure of the adaptive
CHSH game. A, B and C stand for Alice, Bob and Charlie respectively. Bob shares a bipartite resource ρAB with Alice and ρBC with
Charlie.

(17)

Physically, this says that we do not allow for entangled
measurements between the d.o.f.’s within each composite particle. We define the joint state space within each particle in
the same way:
Dc = D1 ˙
⊗D2 ,

(18)

(b1 , · · · , bn ) ∈ (Zk )n (for a k-outcome measurement) produced by the Bobs, weighted by the respective probabilities.
That is, if β⃗b and p⃗b are the CHSH value and probability corresponding to the outcome vector ⃗b respectively, the CHSH
value of the game is calculated as

We now define the effects and states realisable between two
composite particles. The n-partite theory then results from
this input data via the general construction of Sec. II A.
Let

minimal tensor effects:

p⃗b β⃗b .

(16)

⃗b∈(Zk )n

In the case of quantum mechanics, it is trivial to describe an
optimal strategy for the iterated CHSH game: Choose all the
shared states to be the Bell state |Φ+ ⟩. The Bobs perform a
Bell basis measurement each. Conditioned on the outcomes,
the state shared by Alice and Charlie is then one of four elements of the Bell basis, all of which are equiprobable. A local
Pauli operation, performed by either of them, can map it to
|Φ+ ⟩. Hence,
√ it follows that quantum theory retains a CHSH
value of 2 2 for all n.

IV.

COMPOSITE GPTS

The present section is inspired by private communications
with Roger Colbeck, Marc-Olivier Renou, Mirjam Weilenmann, and Elie Wolfe.
Here we discuss a family of constructions that can each
swap PR-box correlations for a fixed number of iterations m.
That is for all n ≤ m, they have a CHSH value of 4 in the iterated CHSH game. But, as we will also show, for all n > m
they have a CHSH value of 2.

Physically it gives rise to the maximally entangled boxworld
states that achieve CHSH values of 4 [8, 9, 21].
In our theory, in addition to product states, we allow for
maximally entangled boxworld states between the first d.o.f.’s
of any two composite particles, and between the first d.o.f. of
one and the second d.o.f. of the other. We thus arrive at the
following cone of composite bipartite states

where we have indicated the tensor factors that any object acts
on in the superscripts: Letters A, B refer to the first and second composite particle, respectively; and numbers 1, 2 to the
internal degrees of freedom.
Finally, the bipartite effects are just the minimal tensor
product of the local ones, except that we allow for maximally
entangled measurements between the second d.o.f.’s of any
two composite particles (This is consistent because no entanglement exists between these particular d.o.f.’s). As in the

can concatenate edges via dual entanglement swapping
as follows:
(vi , wj ) ◦ (vj , wk ) ◦ (vk , wl ) ≡ (vi , wl ) ∈ F.
Lemma 3. Given a composite particle with m boxworld
d.o.f.’s, there exists l ∈ N such that ∀ n ≥ l the CHSH value of
the composite GPT in the iterated CHSH game parametrised
by n, is 2.
Proof. In order to sustain entanglement indefinitely under entanglement swapping with a finite number of d.o.f.’s, we must
have a “closed cycle”. That is, there is some chain of concatenations, alternating edges from E and F (starting and ending
with E) that reproduces the first edge. In equations:
(v1 , w2 ) ◦ (v2 , w3 ) ◦ · · ·
· · · ◦ (vk−1 , wk ) ◦ (vk , w2 ) ≡ (v1 , w2 ) ∈ E,

General construction

In the example just treated, by adding an additional d.o.f.,
we managed to move a PR box past one round of entanglement swapping. It is resonable to conjecture that with access
to more d.o.f.’s one may be able to find a way to sustain entanglement longer, maybe even indefinitely.
To investigate this, we generalise the previous example to
m degrees of freedom. Each d.o.f. supports unipartite boxworld states and effects. Now, for each d.o.f. k we have to
specify the two disjoint subsets of d.o.f.’s that form entangled
states and entangled effects with k. This amounts to specifying two symmetric bipartite graphs as follows:
Start with a collection of 2m vertices, two per d.o.f.
V = {v1 , · · · , vm , w1 , · · · , wm }
= {vi }i=1,··· ,m ∪ {wi }i=1,··· ,m .

3. If (vi , wj ), (vk , wl ) ∈ E and (vj , wk ) ∈ F then, we
can concatenate edges via entanglement swapping as
follows:

(24)

On this vertex set, define two symmetric bipartite graphs,
G = (V, E) and H = (V, F ) (with the same bipartition over
the above indicated subsets), such that they lie in each other’s
complement. The elements of edge sets E and F therefore,
are ordered pairs of vertices, one from each of the subsets
{vi }i=1,··· ,m and {wi }i=1,··· ,m .
Indeed, the edges of graph G specifies those pairs of d.o.f.’s
that can support entangled states, whereas the edges of graph
H give those pairs that can support entangled measurements.
The entire construction can be summarised by the following
rules imposed on the edge sets E and F :
1. If (vi , wj ) ∈ E then (vj , wi ) ∈ E, by symmetry. Same
for F .

(25)

with (vi , wi+1 ) belongs to E for odd i and F for even i.
Since the second and penultimate edge belong to F , we can
use Rule. 4 to simplify the above chain to
(v1 , w2 ) ◦ (v2 , wk ) ◦ (vk , w2 ) ≡ (v1 , w2 )

(26)

The above equation implies that (v1 , w2 ), (vk , w2 ) ∈ E and
(v2 , wk ) ∈ F . But, by Rule. 1 we get (vk , w2 ) ∈ F which
contradicts Rule. 2.
This then means, each time we do an additional round of
entanglement swapping, we have to add a new degree of freedom (if not more).
This implies, given access to m d.o.f.’s, the maximum number of entanglement swapping rounds such that the output is
still entangled is less than or equal to m − 1.
Therefore, for any n ≥ m we end up with only product
states in the iterated CHSH game, meaning the CHSH value
is no more than 2.

OBLATE STABILIZER THEORY

In this section we present our main result. That is, we construct the oblate stabilizer theory, which not only achieves a
CHSH value of 4 but is also stable under entanglement swapping. In other words, it can sustain this CHSH value indefinitely under entanglement swapping. We also show that, given
the resources described by this theory, there is an optimal
strategy by which we get a CHSH value of 4 in the iterated
CHSH game.

A.

Setup

The theory can be obtained by slightly deforming the set
of quantum-mechanical stabilizer states. For this reason, we
will use objects from the mathematical description of quantum
mechanics to construct it.
Consider the one-qubit stabilizer polytope, i.e., the convex
hull of the following states on the Bloch sphere
FRONT VIEW

TO P V I E W

|x± ⟩⟨x± | := 21 (1 ± σ1 ),
|y± ⟩⟨y± | := 12 (1 ± σ2 ),

(27)

|z± ⟩⟨z± | := 12 (1 ± σ3 ),
where σ1 , σ2 , σ3 are the Pauli matrices. Now perform a “uniform stretch in the equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere”, i.e.,
for some r > 1, set

FIG. 6. Caricature of the geometry of the unipartite Oblate Stabilizer
Theory. The black outlines represent a Bloch sphere with a scaled
up equatorial plane. The rays formed by vertices of the red polytope
(what used to be the stabilizer states) represent the extremal rays of
the state cone. The rays formed by vertices of the rotated (about
the z-axis, by π/4) blue polytope represent the extremal rays of the
effect cone.

|x̃± ⟩⟨x̃± | := 12 (1 ± rσ1 ),

B.

|ỹ± ⟩⟨ỹ± | := 12 (1 ± rσ2 ),

π

|z̃± ⟩⟨z̃± | := |z± ⟩⟨z± | = 12 (1 ± σ3 ).
These will be the building blocks for the unipartite state space.
The Bell state is defined as usual as:
|Φ+ ⟩⟨Φ+ | := 14 (σ0 ⊗σ0 +σ1 ⊗σ1 −σ2 ⊗σ2 +σ3 ⊗σ3 ). (29)
It satisfies the standard identities

and

⟩ = √12 (|00⟩ + |11⟩).

(32)

Let R = e−i 8 σ3 be the unitary which, by conjugation
(R( · )R† ), implements a π/4-rotation of the Bloch sphere
about the z-axis.
Let Ω be the stretched stabilizer states, for some choice of
r>1:
Ω := {|x̃± ⟩⟨x̃± |, |ỹ± ⟩⟨ỹ± |, |z̃± ⟩⟨z̃± |}

(36)

Definition 4 (Unipartite Oblate Stabilizer Theory). Choose
√
− 1
r = cos( π4 ) 2 = 4 2, and define the following:
1. The unit effect, 1 := 1, the 2 × 2 identity matrix.

2. The effect cone, P (1) := cone RΩR† .

3. The state cone, D(1) := cone Ω .
Indeed, we get the following derived objects: The negation
of an effect is
¬e = 1 − e.

(37)

From the Bell state, we can generate the Bell basis as:
The state space is simply
+
+
+
|Φ+
µ ⟩⟨Φµ | := (σµ ⊗ 1)|Φ ⟩⟨Φ |(σµ ⊗ 1),

µ ∈ Z4 . (33)

In keeping with the quantum formalism, effects will also be
represented by 2 × 2 matrices and the pairing between states
and effects by the trace inner product. Additionally, partial
contractions between states and effects are realised as partial
traces. For example, for a unipartite effect e1 and bipartite
state ρ12 , the partial contraction is

⟨ρ12 , e1 ⟩ := tr1 ρ12 (e1 ⊗ 1) .

(34)

Similarly, for a bipartite effect e and bipartite states ρ and σ,
the entanglement swapping map is

Jρ e σ K := tr23 ρ12 ⊗ 1⊗2 (1 ⊗ e23 ⊗ 1)1⊗2 ⊗ σ34 . (35)

S (1) = conv(Ω).

(38)

Similarly, the effect space is
E (1) = conv({0, 1} ∪ RΩR† ).

(39)

It is easily verified that we have a well-defined unipartite
theory as:
1. The effect space is closed under negations
¬E (1) = E (1) .

(40)

2. The states are normalised
ρ ∈ S (1)

⇒

tr(ρ1) = 1.

(41)

<!-- page 8 -->
8
3. Pairing a state and an effect gives a probability, i.e.,
ρ ∈ S (1) , e ∈ E (1)

⇒

tr(ρe) ∈ [0, 1].

(42)

It suffices to check (42) for the extremal vertices. Additionally, due to (40) only the upper bound needs to be checked.
From Fig. 6, the inner product on the z-axis is unchanged
from quantum theory and hence bounded between 0 and 1.
On the equatorial plane the largest inner product is between
two nearest neighbours. By construction, the angle enclosed
by the corresponding Bloch vectors is π/4, meaning

(43)
sup tr(ρe) = 12 1 + r2 cos(π/4) = 1.

C.

Bipartite Theory

To construct the bipartite theory we first interpret the bipartite states as maps from the unipartite effect cone to the
unipartite state cone, via partial contraction. Similarly for bipartite effects (refer Fig. 2 (a) (b)). Then, we use the following
properties of the unipartite theory:
1. Both the state and effect cones are invariant under conjugation by Pauli matrices. In the Bloch picture, these
correspond to reflections about the x, y, and z-axes.
2. Both state and effect cones are invariant under matrix
transpose. In the Bloch picture, this corresponds to reflections about the xz-plane.
3. Both the state and effect cones are invariant under conjugation by Rm for m ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6}. In the Bloch picture this corresponds to a mπ/4-rotation about the zaxis.
4. On the other hand, conjugation by Rm for m ∈
{1, 3, 5, 7} maps the state cone to the effect cone and
vice-versa.
Therefore, for µ ∈ Z4 , m ∈ Z8 define the projections
+
m †
+
+
m
|Φ+
µ,m ⟩⟨Φµ,m | := (σµ R ) ⊗1|Φ ⟩⟨Φ |(σµ R )⊗1. (44)

Further, define the set

+
Φ := |Φ+
µ,m ⟩⟨Φµ,m | µ ∈ Z4 , m ∈ Z8 , m odd .

Proof. We verify that Algorithm 1 accepts the data, which is
thus consistent by Lemma 2.
The partial trace of all entangled states introduced is 12 1.
Partial contractions of entangled effects with unipartite states
can be viewed as conjugation by a odd rotation, and then by
a Pauli matrix. This, as discussed before, maps the unipartite
state cone to the unipartite effect cone. Therefore, by construction, the D(1) and P (1) assigned by the algorithm are the
same D(1) and P (1) as in Def. 4. Hence, we already have
1 ∈ P (1) and ⟨D(1) , P (1) ⟩ ≥ 0.
Since the entangled states and effects are projectors taken
from quantum theory without modification, the trace inner
product between them is non-negative.
We have verified above that pairing unipartite states and effects leads to positive outcomes, and this property is preserved
under tensor products.
Using identities (30) and (31), it can be easily shown that

 1
m t
m †
+
tr |Φ+
µ,m ⟩⟨Φµ,m |e ⊗ f = 2 tr f σµ R e (R ) σµ , (46)
which is just 12 times the pairing between a unipartite state
and effect, and hence, is positive. The same argument extends
to entangled effects and product states. Therefore, we have
⟨D, P ⟩ ≥ 0.
For invariance under permutation of systems, we need only
check S2 invariance for the set of entangled states and effects,
since everything else is permutation invariant by construction.
This is readily verified by using identity (30) since |Φ+ ⟩⟨Φ+ |
is already S2 invariant.
The tensor products of the unipartite cones, P (1) ⊗P (1) and
(1)
D ⊗D(1) are subsets of, respectively, P and D by construction.
It remains to be shown that the theory is closed under entanglement swapping and dual entanglement swapping. We
only treat the first case explicitly. The dual version follows
in complete analogy. We separate the entanglement swapping
contractions into four types.

1. The effect factorizes, i.e., • e⊗f • . In this case the result is an element of D(1) ⊗ D(1) , because the contraction splits as follows:

Definition 5 (Oblate Stabilizer Theory). In the sense of
Sec. II A, oblate stabilizer theory is the theory specified by the
following data:
1. V , the set of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices,
2. 1 = 1, the 2 × 2 identity matrix,

3. P = cone RΩR† ⊗ RΩR† ∪ Φ ,

4. D = cone Ω ⊗ Ω ∪ Φ .
Lemma 6. The data specified in Def. 5, can be consistently
extended to a theory using Alg. 1.

2. Both states are product states, i.e., Jρ1 ⊗ρ2 • ρ3 ⊗ρ4 K. In
this case the result is again an element of D(1) ⊗ D(1) ,
because the central objects can be grouped as:
e

ρ1

ρ2

3. Thereq is one yentangled state and one entangled effect,
i.e., Φ Φ ρ⊗σ for example. In this case the result is

<!-- page 9 -->

once again an element of D(1) ⊗ D(1) , because we can
split up the contraction as:
Φ

Therefore, none of the conditions required to detect inconsistency in Algorithm 1 are met. And hence, it does not return
“inconsistent”.

Theorem 8. Oblate stabilizer theory reaches a value of β = 4
in the iterated CHSH game.
Proof. Build the two-setting two-outcome measurement machines of Alice and Charlie out of the correlators
A0 = rRσ1 R† ,

A1 = rRσ2 R† ,

C0 = rRσ1 R† ,

C1 = rRσ2 R† .

(48)

B1 = R|ỹ+ ⟩⟨ỹ+ |R† − R|ỹ− ⟩⟨ỹ− |R† = rRσ2 R† .
Since this is the maximum possible value, the CHSH value
associated with this theory, as defined in Eqn. (12), is also 4.
Also, ∀ ρ ∈ D(2) we have (refer to Appendix VIII A)
z
r
+
|Φ+
0,1 ⟩⟨Φ0,1 |
+
+
∝ρ
(49)
ρ
|Φ ⟩⟨Φ |

Therefore, we not only have closure but also stability under
both entanglement swapping and dual entanglement swapping.
Remark 7. It is worth pointing out here that the choice of
correlators being only on the xy-plane is no coincidence. For
any situation with a z-measurement, oblate stabilizer theory
no longer has such a strong CHSH violation.
The general strategy for the iterated CHSH game for Oblate
Stabilizer Theory is the same as the optimal strategy for quantum theory discussed in Sec. III.
Alice and Charlie have access to two-setting two-outcome
measurement machines. The Bobs have access to fouroutcome bipartite measurement machines. In each run of the
experiment, nearest neighbours share a bipartite Oblate Stabilizer State. Each Bob performs a bipartite measurement on
the sub-systems available to him and broadcasts his outcome.
Based on this, either Alice or Charlie apply a correction locally and perform a CHSH test.

(50)

As we have noted in (48), the above are valid correlators of
the theory. For the four-outcome measurements, choose

+
(51)
MBi = |Φ+
µ,1 ⟩⟨Φµ,1 | µ ∈ Z4 , ∀ i.
From (33) it follows that MBi is a measurement. For the
shared bipartite states, choose

ρAB1 = ρB1 B2 = · · · = ρBn C = |Φ+

(52)

Given these choices one can verify (refer to Appendix. VIII B) that the four output states obtained after each
consecutive entanglement swap are the same. Each state is
also equiprobable. The output state after n rounds depends
solely on the multiplicity of each of the four outcomes of
MBi , in the vector ⃗b = (b1 , · · · , bn ) ∈ (Z4 )n . Therefore to
obtain the proper correction one can convert the outcomes to
binary and perform a bit-wise XOR (equivalent to finding the
resultant element of the Klein four-group). The output state
and correction corresponding to each µ ∈ Z4 is tabulated in
Tab. I.
+
The correction maps each output state back to |Φ+
0,1 ⟩⟨Φ0,1 |,
which gives a CHSH value of 4 with the above choice of correlators as was stated earlier. And therefore, we have

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have constructed a GPT in which a CHSH violation of
4 can be sustained indefinitely under entanglement swapping.
As a consequence, the iterated CHSH game is insufficient to
single out QM among GPTs.
In the process of obtaining this result, we have also set up a
framework to turn bipartite theories into multipartite theories
in which entanglement swapping is consistently defined.

<!-- page 10 -->
10
As an outlook to future work, Ref. [20] suggests that theories should satisfy stronger symmetry conditions, i.e., “...for
any state and set of local measurements, if the local outcome
probabilities are permuted, then there is a state that achieves
these permuted correlations under the same measurements”.
If this is interpreted as an invarience under permutation of subsystems, then oblate stabilizer theory satisfies this requirement. If instead we interpret this as a symmetry under permutation of extremal effects, then our construction fails to satisfy
this requirement. In particular, our construction breaks the
symmetry between z-observables and those on the equatorial
plane. This raises two complementary questions for further
work: (1) Are there natural, stronger conditions on multipartite correlations for which QM is indeed optimal? (2) Can one
find a theory that beats QM in the iterated CHSH game and
that is isotropic in the sense of having a transitive symmetry

group action on all extremal effects?

Finally, we can specialize to the case of the optimal strategy for the iterated CHSH game. For n = 1:
A = σ0 R,

B = σµ R,

C = σ0 R =⇒ CBA = Rσµ

We can calculate the output of n = 2 by entering the output of the first round into the second round, i.e.,
A = Rσµ ,

B = σν R,

C = σ0 R =⇒ CBA = σ0 Rσν RRσµ = Rσν σµ .

These are the same four states as n = 1 up to scaling and factors of ±i, which are eliminated since they come in complex
conjugate pairs. This means that the set of output states is closed. Moreover, each time we have conjugation by an additional
Pauli matrix. The final result therefore depends only on the number of time each Pauli matrix occurs. That is, it depends on the
multiplicity of each member of Z4 in the outcome vector ⃗b = (b1 , · · · , bn ).
